useReducer hook takes reducer function and initialState as an argument. This reducer
is not the reducer function of redux but its structure is same, it also returns an object and
takes state and action as its argument.
The useReducer returns the current state and a dispatch method along with it. This dispatch
method also returns an object like redux dispatch function.

**************************************************************
Example:
initialState = {
    count: 0,
}

const reducer = (state,action){
    switch(action.type){
        case 'increment':
            return {...state,count:state.count++};
    }
    return state
}

const [currentState,dispatch] = useRef(reducer,initialState);

<Button onPress = {() => dispatch({type:'increment'})}
*****************************************************************
in the reducer function, the reducer will automatically get the values of initialState to
its state argument. When the dispatch will be called the object of the dispatch will be
automatically gets by the action argument of the reducer.
