# Error: Value for message cannot be cast from ReadableNativeMap to String.
solution: if we want to use the err message from catch statement directly in Alert or in other
component in string formate then this error arise. To solve this we need to use "err.message" to
get the error message.

try{

}catch(err){
    err.message // it is correct form to use
}
